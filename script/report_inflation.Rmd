## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


```{r report IQR for geneomic inflation factor, echo=TRUE}

# import list of Lambda factors from PWAS 
path_lambdas <- "/exchange/healthds/pQTL/results/META_CHRIS_INTERVAL/qced_sumstats_digits_not_flipped/inflation_factors_table.tsv"

gwas_qc <- fread(path_lambdas)

lgc_median <- median(gwas_qc$lambda_GC)
lgc_min <- min(gwas_qc$lambda_GC)
lgc_max <- max(gwas_qc$lambda_GC)

cat("median:", lgc_median,
    "\n min:",   lgc_min,
    "\n max:",   lgc_max)

```

Genomic inflation was well controlled (median λGC = `r lgc_median` (range: `r lgc_min` – `r lgc_max`)).

In the paper (v.2), I included the range as follows:
Genomic inflation was well controlled (median λGC = 1.005 (range: 0.975–1.094)).
